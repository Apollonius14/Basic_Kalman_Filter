### Robotics Motion Estimation and Mapping

Solution to Kalman Filter programming assignment (week 2) of the coursera
course here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-flight/ 

Author(s): UPenn School of Engineering and Applied Science

Contributor: Omar Kadhim - Summer 2018

A simple 2D motion estimation script which uses combines information from a 
previously known state, a new observation and known position sensor noise
to estimate the current state.

IP Disclaimer: I am not sure whether I'm allowed to re-use and make public
this modified software library. I genuinely only want to do so to showcase
my work, advertised my interest in the area and further my hobby/DIY drone
ambitions NOT FOR COMMERCIAL GAIN. Coursera and UPenn: if this is a problem
please let me know and I'll happily comply with whatever you want.

### Update Log:

Rev1: Jul 2018. Uploaded as just finished course.

### Getting Started:

Files: 
Ensure they are all in the same directory and run example_test.m
You can visualise the results of varying sensor noise and position
uncertainity in the script kalmanFilter.m
